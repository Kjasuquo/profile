               <h2>JOSEPH ASUQUO</h2>
               <p>
                I am Joseph Asuquo, a Power System Engineering graduate from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO).
                You may be wondering, “Why is a power system engineer suddenly interested in Tech?”<br>
                For Starters, I studied engineering especially power systems because I am a problem solver. 
                At the time of my admission, power was (and still is) a major challenge in Nigeria and 
                I wanted to better equip myself with the skills to solve the challenge.
                <br>
                <br>
                After graduation, I practiced power system engineering in different sectors hoping to use my problem-solving skills to change things. 
                But as the case may be, I was just carrying out routine maintenances and I felt my skills in solving problems were not being utilized to their full potential. 
                This made me re-evaluate my choice of a career path. 
                And I got to find out that tech goes beyond typing documents and browsing the internet, it takes special skills to see a need or problem and come up with a solution.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>The next question for me was “Where do I start from?”</b></p>
            
            <p>
                After much deliberation, in May 2021, I decided to get a certification from the British Computer Society – BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT. 
                Thereafter, I came across the Decagon internship program and it just felt like the right move at the right time to make the difficult but inevitable switch from power to tech.
                And currently I specialize in GoLang.
                <br>Going forward, as a software engineer, I want to be in an organization where my problem-solving skills will be appreciated.
            </p>
